        "Pruning is a technique employed to compress machine learning models by selectively removing parts of the network that are deemed unnecessary. Specifically, it involves cutting away certain neural connections or layers that contribute little to the model's performance. Despite these reductions, pruning helps maintain the model’s overall accuracy and effectiveness, thereby lowering computational requirements and improving efficiency. This approach allows for a leaner, faster model without sacrificing its ability to deliver high-quality results."
